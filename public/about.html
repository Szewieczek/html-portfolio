<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have enjoyed acquiring foreign languages ever since I was a student. During my one-year sojourn at a German grammar school, I made significant strides in mastering the German language, progressing from A2 to C1 level. 📈 Additionally, through my involvement in the "Flat buddy" program at Charles University, I honed my English speaking skills🗣, I learned Russian just for fun. 🪆 And prior to relocating to Tesin Silesia, I had also attended Polish classes. ❤️. During my maternity leave, I started to learn the exotic languages SQL and Java and I am a graduate of the course Digital Academy: Testing at Czechitas 🚀 In my current role, I am actively expanding my knowledge by acquainting myself with writing more robust and dependable test scripts in Cypress.</p>
